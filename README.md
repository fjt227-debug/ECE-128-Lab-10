# ECE-128-Lab-10
The objective of this lab is to design and implement a complete digital system capable of reading two inputs from ROM, multiplying them using a combinational multiplier, storing the result in RAM, and being driven by the control unit. This project uses multiple previously developed components from earlier lab assignments to create a single functional block. The main objective is to write a top module for the full system, verifying through a testbench and simulation waveforms, and implementing the design on the FPGA board. Overall the lab's purpose is to develop a whole systems design and understand how memory, data path, and control logic interact in a complete hardware design. 1) Copy files to Vivado project and input into Design Sources 2) Copy testbench to Simulation Sources 4) Run sysnthesis and implementation 5) Generate bitstream 6) Program the FPGA board 7) Run the program
